### Spark Image
Each spark binary comes with scripts to create image for a container environment.
We will be leveraging the image cloudnativek8s/spark:3.3.2 which can be found at https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudnativek8s/spark/tags

The image uses Java 17 and spark 3.3.+ with UID value of 10000. It is an alpine based image.
